                                  The Shinbundang Line Private Investment Project was promoted to improve the serious traffic congestions due to the rapid population increase in the southeastern part of the capital area and the new town development in Pangyo. Although the Bundang Subway Line was already in operation, traffic efficiency has already dropped because of frequent transfers and a heavy dependence on cars caused traffic congestion.         <br><br>
                                    
                                  As a result, discussions have been held since 1999 to build the Shinbundang Line to supplement the low traffic efficiency of the existing Bundang Line and to alleviate the traffic congestion in the northwest region of Yongin to establish a long-term metropolitan railway network. <br class="br_pc">
                                  Later, in April 2000, the project was promoted in earnest as it was selected as a project to be urgently promoted through the Ministry of Construction and Transportation’s ‘Measures to Improve Traffic in the Southern Region of the Metropolitan Area.’  <br><br>
                                    
                                  The Shinbundang Line was the first railway in Korea led by a private company, from planning to design, financing, construction to operation; and it was evaluated as a model for pioneering new markets that would prove to be qualified to carry out later the pan-national mega-project through carrying out the planning, construction, and operation of national key industries.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  The Shinbundang Subway Line Project was carried out in three sectors: 
                                  Phase 1 is the construction of the double-track railway of 18.5 km in total length, which connects Yeoksam-dong(Gangnam station) to Jeongja-dong(Jeongja station) in Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si; and it includes 6 stations(Gangnam, Yangjae, Yangjae Citizen’s Forest, Cheonggyesan Entrance, Pangyo, Jeongja)
                                  <br><br>
                                    
                                  The entire sections of Phase 1 were built under ground for the convenience of passengers and environment protection; and this line starts from Gangnam Station, connecting Yangjae, Yangjae Citizen’s Forest, Cheonggyesan Entrance, Pangyo, and Jeongja. <br class="br_pc">
                                  This is a large-scale civil engineering project, with a project cost of 1.6 trillion won; and on completion of the project the ownership reverts to the state. It is the BTO–style project in which Neo-Trans(Co., Ltd.), the operating corporation, secures the operating rights for 30 years.

                              The Shinbundang Subway built by Doosan E&C introduced the unmanned operation system to the heavy railway for the first time in Korea, which caught the attention of the public. And for safe operation the railway was equipped with high-tech systems and up-to-date facilities, such as real-time remote monitoring & control system. The train was equipped with emergency exit doors in the front and rear of the rail motor car; and inside the tunnel located between Pangyo and Cheonggyesan Entrance a rescue shelter that can hold about 570 passengers was installed for a rapid and safe evacuation in an emergency.

                              The construction for all three phases was full of difficulties but in particular since the Phase 1 construction site was located along the street Gangnam-daero, so the tension on safety and the environment could not be relaxed for a moment. Above all, a minor mistake could lead to a major accident given the site conditions where more than 100,000 vehicles pass daily and high-rise buildings are concentrated. Therefore, an automated measurement systems that can collect real-time measurement data was implemented and variation was checked in real time.  <br><br>
                                
                              In addition, 24-hour monitoring was carried out through CCTV, and a safety monitoring team was assigned to stay 24 hours day and night on the site to closely watch and control the safety of the place. And also a great effort was made to improve the environment of the site, by introducing eco-friendly elements such as artificial-grass soundproof walls, the wastewater treatment facility, and industrial-use vacuum cleaners; and as a result, the Prize of the Minister of Land and Maritime Affairs was awarded to our project for its best practice at the Construction Site Environmental Management Competition, hosted by the Construction Association of Korea; therefore our company became a benchmarking object of other companies.

                                  The Shinbundang Subway Line to be Completed as a Metrorail of 50 km  
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                  Following the opening of Phase 1(Gangnam~Jeongja), the construction of Phase 2 was begun. The scale of Phase 2 is 12.8 km in length, and contains one railway depot and 7 stations(Migeum, Dongcheon, Suji-gucheong, Seongbok, Sanghyeon, Gwanggyo-jungang, Gwanggyo). The Gwanggyo Railway Depot is 43,636㎡ in total floor area, and 27,245㎡(8,241.6 pyeong) in building area; and it houses a total of 16 buildings including the Vehicle Maintenance Department, the Main Factory, and the Cleansing Department. The construction capability of this railway depot was highly valued, so the Bronze Prize was awarded to this project for its high-level performance, at “The Best Civil Engineering Structure Competition of the Year” in 2016, hosted by the Korea Society of Civil Engineering. <br><br>
                                    
                                  Phase 3-1(Sinsa~Gangnam), which links the existing Shinbundang Subway Line to central Seoul, was begun in 2016 and completed in May 2022, with the aim of giving the citizens, living in southern Seoul and the metropolitan area, better accessibility to downtown Seoul.  <br><br>
                                    
                                  Phase 3-1, 2.5 km in length, is the line that is connected to Sinsa(Line 3)-Nonhyeon(Line7)-Shinnonhyeon(Line 9)-Gangnam(Line2). Before the opening of the Phase 3-1 Line, it took over 1 hour to transfer between bus and subway from Sinsa to Gwanggyo; but the opening of this line shortened the time by 20 mins so it could arrive in 42 minutes.

                                  Meanwhile, Doosan E&C is planning to break ground in 2026 for the Phase 3-2 Project for the section between Yongsan and Sinsa (5.3 km, 3 stations), and is also promoting the section between Gwanggyo and Homaesil (11.1km). If the above-mentioned three-sector lines are all opened, the Shinbundang Line, with a total length of 50km, will become a wide-area railway that is true to its name.
