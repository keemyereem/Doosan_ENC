                        <dd>
                          I started working on Public Private Partnership (PPP) project in March 2004 when I joined the SB-PROJECT team at the head office. 
                          Since then, I have worked at SB Construction Project Unit (Gangnam~Jeongja Construction Group) from March 2005 to July 2012, and now am working at the Shinbundang Yongsan Construction Project Unit (Yongsan~Gangnam) from July 2012 to the present, And I participated, As a concurrent position for a project proposal, in the Shinbundang Line 2nd phase (Jeongja~Gwanggyo) project in 2006.

                        <dt><span></span>What was the assessment and significance of the Shinbundang Line, both internally and externally? </dt>
                        <dd>
                          The Shinbundang Line is the first railway project in Korea ever led by a private company, from planning to design, financing, construction, and operation.  
                          Currently, PPP projects Have been activated in the railway field, but when the construction of the first phase(Gangnam~Jeongja) of the Shinbundang Line began, it was a very foreign business structure. 
                          Therefore, I used to work hard to explain and understand the relevant contents to the competent authorities (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, And Transport, Korea national railway) and local governments at each stage of the project. 
                          The Shinbundang Line is not only technically the first in Korea, but also operated by an unmanned heavy rail that is rare in the world. 
                          When the construction of the first phase (Gangnam~Jeongja) began, there were many doubts internally and externally about whether unmanned driving would be possible. 
                          However, with the successful opening of the Shinbundang Line, the light rail project is also being promoted with unmanned driving, and some existing heavy Rail lines have also been able to operate some sections unmanned.
                          Considering these changes, I think it is not an exaggeration to say that the Shinbundang Line is a groundbreaking project that changed the paradigm Of domestic urban railways in Korea.

                        <dd>
                          All the projects I participated in are memorable, but the recently opened Phase 3-1 (Sinsa~Gangnam) is the most Memorable one
                          Rather than remembering the work because it was hard and difficult, I remember it a lot because the project manager, site manager, and employees who participated in the construction all worked hard to open the line in a timely Fashion and also helped and encouraged each other, and had a strong camaraderie.

                        <dd>
                          The construction projects for Nonhyeon Station (Line 7 Transfer), Shinnonhyeon Station (Line 9 Transfer), Gangnam Station (Line 2 Transfer), and Yangjae Station (Line 3 Transfer), where excavations were carried out under Gangnam-daero, were all difficult works 
                          It was indescribably difficult and challenging to construct transfer stations while relocating the Gangnam-daero Central Bus Lane.  
                          Also, though I did not participate in the construction of Phase 2, Migeum Station (Bundang Line Transfer), I would pay my respect to all those who participated in this construction Since I heard it was as difficult as Gangnam-daero.

                        <dd>
                          It was the most difficult to successfully apply the 'Train Control System (in radio signals) which is the core of unmanned driving technology. Many of our civil engineering, architecture, electricity, and machinery engineers have made tremendous efforts to communicate and cooperate day and night for unmanned operation.
                          While externally Doosan E&C's train control system experience and technology are highly appreciated, internally, the evaluation is not so generous—I feel sorry about it.
                          
                          And due to COVID-19 the entire city of Toronto (Ontario), Canada, where the CBTC* source technology company, Thales Group, is located, has been shut down. 
                          As a result, local engineers could not Fly in Korea and could only work from home, making communication very difficult. In addition, there were delays in bringing in the equipment made by a local factory, and to make matters worse, the wrong equipment was often delivered. In the end, all the project leaders and staff worked day and night through many hardships to open the line safely.

                        <dd>
                          As worked in the project unit, I became more involved in railway project management than in civil engineering, which was my original major. I met a lot of people through various tasks such as licensing, interface for each field, and commissioning, and there were many difficulties to solve while doing unfamiliar tasks. But it is very rewarding because it is something that can only be experienced in the Shinbundang Line project.

                        <dd>
                          The commissioning period was about a year and a half before the opening of phase 3-1(Sinsa~Gangnam).
                          The commissioning was carried out on a 68km round trip between Sinsa and Gwanggyo including the existing operating line. We had to run a test drive after operating hours in the Gangnam~Gwanggyo section in operation. If we include the time for preparation process, there was lack of time enough to make one round trip between Sinsa and Gwanggyo, so I feel much worried before carrying out a test drive. Due to COVID-19 the operation time for the Shinbundang Line was shortened one hour, which made a smooth test drive possible for an additional hour. I didn’t know if I should cry or laugh in this situation. After completing the test drives overnight, we had to have, for over one year, just instant bowl noodle or convenience store gimbap as a meal after the test drive in the early morning.
                          Due to COVID-19 late night business was limited, and it was hard to have a proper meal during overnight sift. The commissioning used to end around 4~5 a.m., when food couldn't be delivered, so there were no other choices. We had difficulties like this, but at the same time proud experiences. 
                          I went on a trip to Europe with my family during summer vacation, and I happened to see a promotional leaflet for the Shinbundang Line technology in Austria. In the morning, at the hotel, my son suddenly said that the Shinbundang Line was on TV, I thought it was a joke, but when I saw the actual broadcast, I felt very proud in front of my family.

                        <dd>
                          At the beginning of working on the Shinbundang Line I was an assistant manager, and then rose through the ranks of division manager, deputy chief, and then department manager. Some people envy that I know more about the project than anyone else because I have dug only one well, but to be honest, I still have so much to learn about the railway sector and it is difficult.

                          When I have experienced three times openings, I felt a rush of emotion at the moment of opening and I felt that the difficult moments would pass through my head like a flashlight, but when I thought of the remaining work for me to complete, nothing came to my mind. The only thing is that, after spending 80~90% of my corporate life, longer than my stay at home, on the Shinbundang Line, I felt satisfied as if I had completed my own house to live in.
