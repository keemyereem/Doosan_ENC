                            <p>
                              Bundang Doosan Tower is the Doosan Group’s newly built headquarter building, with 7 floors underground and 27 floors above ground, a total floor area of 130,000 square meters, 130 meters in height. 
                              If Doosan Group's former headquarter building, named Dongdaemun Doota, has the symbolism of being located at the gateway to the old city center, 
                              the new headquarter building, named Bundang Doosan Tower, is a symbolic milestone for the newly emerging Doosan Group, 
                              located at the entrance to Seoul of the Gyeongbu Expressway, and it has emerged as a city landmark while having the image of a gateway.  <br><br>
                                
                              The shape of the building was combined into four masses with vertical and horizontal stone louvers, and the design concept of a pinwheel was reflected in the facade.  
                              The mass is designed to give a simple yet powerful impression and feels the weight of the stone louvers, 
                              and the open space runs through the center of the building seeking harmony with the surrounding landscape without interrupting the urban flow.  
                              In particular, the granite material with a wave pattern displays natural cuts on the cross-section in front to maintain the unique texture of the stone.  
                              In addition, the granite louvers allow you to look out over the view and scenery of Bundang without obstructing the important view from the inside, 
                              and from the outside, the exterior of the building changes depending on the viewing position, playing an aesthetic role.

                            Bundang Doosan Tower is a collaboration of the world-famous KPF (Kohn Pederson Fox Associates), 
                            based in New York, Gansam Architecture (led by Kim Tae-jip), a leading design firm in Korea, and Doosan E&C, 
                            which has been completed by the continuous cooperation between we throughout the entire process from planning to construction. 
                            In addition to design for planning and the design for construction, they completed this project together 
                            by communicating with the contractor until the final stage of construction, 
                            realizing a workplace environment for comfortable and pleasant work and various interior spaces configurations.

                            <p>
                                Bundang Doosan Tower’s Lift-up construction is the top-level construction technology of lifting up and combining the sky bridge structure of 1500 tons, at one time, to the height of 120 meters above ground. 
                                This technology made headlines in construction technology, as a successful case for the heaviest mass in general architecture, and has been recorded as a major success case for Lift-up technology.                             
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For this Lift-up, the sky bridge of 35m in length, 30m in width, and 4 layers in height was put together on the ground for 4 months; and then it was continuously lifted for 20 consecutive hours, at 5 meters per hour to safely complete the Lift-up. Although the Lift-up method is a very risky and anomalous construction with high level of difficulties, because it is sensitive to the preparation process like wind velocity and weather, it has successfully proved the high level of Doosan E&C’s technology through the high-tech endeavor on site and support from experts.

                            <h3>Bundang Doosan Tower, a Brand-new Role Model for Office Buildings </h3>
                            <p>
                                Bundang Doosan Tower strikingly boasts its majesty among the numerous IT companies and other office buildings in Pangyo and Jeongja-dong, and has been established as a landmark of the region.
                                While pursuing both reasonable simplicity and clarity of design using a huge and heavy mass, this tower well preserves the characteristics of an office building. The Tower presents the sense of weight and the sense of stability, and it has become an acclaimed office building. Because of the construction methods and materials applied, it has become a role model and benchmarking object for new office buildings under construction, and is highly regarded as a source of pride for Doosan E&C’s general construction technology.
