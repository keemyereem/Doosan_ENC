                                Haeundae Doosan We’ve the Zenith</h3>
                            <p>
                                Haeundae Doosan We’ve the Zenith is an 80-story, 300-meter-tall high-end residential-commecial complex that was completed in 2012 with the spectacular title of "the tallest residential building in Korea." 
                                In addition, as a collage of new technology and new construction method widely applied, this masterpiece attracted the attention of the people of the world. <br>
                                <br>
                                Among the many features, the first that stands out is the appearance. 
                                The exterior, which embodies the waves of the coastal sea of Haeundae Beach and the flow of Jangsan Mountain, 
                                blends exquisitely with the surrounding environment; 
                                and a curtain wall system is applied throughout the buildings to create a dynamic image made by the reflection of sun. 
                                In addition, the natural skyline created by the three buildings of 70, 75, or 80 floors each shows the essence of architectural aesthetics.<br>
                                <br>
                                Haeundae Doosan We’ve the Zenith is a collaboration made together by Doosan E&C and the world's leading global companies. 
                                The architectural design was undertaken by DeStefano & Partners of the United States, which has a worldwide reputation in the field of skyscraper design, 
                                while Landscape design was handled by SWA Group, a master of eco-friendly landscaping that has carried out projects 
                                such as Disney World and Stanford University in the United States, and the University of Tokyo in Japan.

                                    초고층 건축물의 핵심은 안전성에 있는 만큼
                                    해운대 두산위브더제니스는 최첨단 공법을 결집해 시공에 적용하였습니다.
                                    안전성 최적설계를 구현하는 기업으로 평가받고 있는
                                    미국 손톤-토마세티를 구조설계에 참여시켰으며, 300m 상공에서
                                    초속 40m의 강풍과 리히터 규모 7.0의 강진에도 견딜 수 있도록
                                    횡력저항 구조시스템을 도입한 내진 및 내풍 특등급 설계를 적용했습니다.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The SHM (Structural Health Monitoring) system, a futuristic structural diagnosis automation system 
                                    that can monitor the condition of the building in real time, 
                                    such as wind load, seismic load, and other working loads, has also been applied.
                                    Additionally, in the event of a fire, to prevent spalling failure that happens as concrete is exposed to high temperatures, 
                                    the building was constructed with the concrete that applied the new spalling resistance technologies.

                                    In particular, to prevent disasters in these high-rise buildings with disaster-prone areas, 
                                    a dedicated evacuation space was installed for the first time in Korea so that residents can safely evacuate in case of fire. 
                                    Additionally, refuge areas were installed on every third floor with the exception of the penthouse. 
                                    This space is to be used normally as a space for residents' interaction and rest, and as an evacuation space in case of fire.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In addition, it left many new records, upon completion, such as the construction of the largest thickness (3.9m) 
                                    and the largest volume (15,000㎥) of mat concrete in Korea, and the construction of the largest diameter (25m) 
                                    and deepest excavation (60m) of RCD in Korea as the foundation for residential buildings.

                              The landscaping is also one of the prides of Haeundae Doosan We’ve the Zenith. With the landscaping concept of "a forested complex, a futuristic community complex where people live together, 
                              and a cultural complex with health and friendly life," the focus was on capturing nature in the city center. <br><br>
                                
                              Rather than simply arranging the landscape trees in a beautiful way, we built a forested complex to create a theme where the path and the forest blend together. 
                              In addition, a theme garden for each space was created to express a cultural complex with healthy and friendly life. <br>
