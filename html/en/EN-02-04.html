                      The Institute of Technology has performed national projects, as well as industry-university joint research, industry-industry joint research, and internal projects, with excellent research results that combine theory and practice.<br>
                      With Doosan We’ve the Zenith in Haeundae, Daegu, and Ilsan as representative examples of our technologies developed for tall-bulidings, we are doing our best to research leading quality improvements and future technologies based on these discoveries.<br>
                      We are also striving to gain leadership in the construction market by upgrading our technological competitiveness, through the development and dissemination of new technologies / construction methods. In addition, we are focusing our efforts on developing safe, convenient, and high-quality construction technologies.<br>
                      Furthermore, are developing the stable floor noise maintenance and IoT based floor noise-proof technologies, which has recently emerged as a social issue.<br>
                      Finally, we have a new construction technology for a construction site worker location tracking system, which is the first of its kind in Korea, and we are striving to create a living space that combines ESG and eco-friendly technologies through continuous investments, where people can enjoy a healthy and pleasant lifestyle.

                              Through a study that focused on the spalling resistance of high-strength concrete, we developed a technology that improves the residual strength by mixing 0.1% of polypropylene fiber and laterally restraining the concrete with a metal lath.
                              By putting this to practical use, we obtained certification for a NET in the construction field and registered a patent for the technology, and we are planning to continue our research on spalling resistance technologies.
