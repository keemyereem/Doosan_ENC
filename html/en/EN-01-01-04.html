                            At the time of the ground-breaking, I supported the construction work as head of the planning team, 
                            and since July 2019, I worked as director of the Bundang Doosan Tower site, 
                            and have worked since the completion of the construction in December 2021 until the move-in date.

                        <dd>
                            Bundang Doosan Tower is located in the center of the pedestrian paths nearby Jeongja-dong Cafe Alley and the Naver Office Building, and is adjacent to the Shinbundang Subway Line Jeongja Station. 
                            At the time of ground-breaking, it was the only site in the active city-center surrounded by a sound barrier, so it looked out of place with the surroundings. 
                            Under the circumstances, the news that the Doosan Group headquarter Building will be newly built had raised expectations among nearby merchants and residents. And since there are residential, office buildings and shopping areas nearby, 
                            I. as director in charge of the construction, had no little concern of public complaints.

                            Since it was an important project to construct our group headquarter building, I could secure as many employees as possible, who are experienced in general construction, such as construction, COST Control, mechanical, electrical, and safety works, owing to the abundant supply from the company.
                            In addition, since it is a large job site for a single general building, there was a great support in selecting excellent partner companies. There was no less than about 40 of employees on site, I, as site director, emphasized teamwork, as it was important to ensure an atmosphere of good communication between employees. 
                            Thankfully, I think that the on-site staff members worked as a team with pride and passion to build a special project, so this wonderful Bundang Doosan Tower has been born.

                        <dd>
                            As mentioned earlier, it was the only large group headquarter building built in Jeongja-dong, Bundang, the central commercial district, located on the only site that remained undeveloped, so it had various advantages and disadvantages.
                            In particular, it was a site that attracts a lot of attention externally, and if even a small issue occurred during construction, it could hit the headlines. So, we paid special attention to safety, environment, and public complaints. 
                            In addition, as a group headquarter building, there were many requirements from affiliates and employees to work at Bundang Doosan Tower. 
                            When the construction of the higher part of the group headquarter building began, it was shown to a large number of people traveling to and from Seoul through the toll gate of the Gyeongbu Expressway, receiving a lot of assessment and anticipation. 
                            So, keeping in mind the publicity effect, a large banner with holiday greetings was placed on the building and often appeared in the news.

                        <dd>
                            Among the various difficulties I had during construction, the most unforgettable thing was the construction of the sky bridge located on the 24th ~27th floors using the lift-up method.
                            I still can't forget the relief and pride of the moment when we completed the lift-up process of, first, assembling about 1,500 tons of heavy material on the ground for 4 months, and then lifting it up at a rate of 5 meters per hour for 20 hours, and finally combining it with the appointed upper layer, 120 meters in height. From planning the Skybridge to lifting it up, safety concerns and fear of failure weighed even more heavily on me as site director. Therefore, in order to overcome the burden and successfully complete this construction, I encouraged employees and experts to take care of the process in detail step by step. 
                            Now, I can boast it with a smile, but at that time, I was under the heaviest stress that I had never experienced in my life.

                        <dd>
                            It was a shortage of on-site staff members. With completion just around the corner, there was an unexpected situation key employees were being moved. 
                            As a result, the demand for substitutes and the work load on the remaining employees increased.  So I remember asking the support department of the head office for a lot of cooperation. 
                            think I threw all my effort into staffing while at the same time making sure work continued without issues with the remaining employees.

                            Putting all aside, it was the moment when the lift-up was completed.  At about 10 a.m., after checking everything including safety and weather conditions, the lift-up began.
                            All the site employees and partner employees kept their eyes on the lift-up for about 20 hours continuously.
                            The moment was clearly etched in my mind when the final step of the lift-up process, prepared about a year and four months, was completed around 6 a.m at sunrise.  
                            And I can't forget the taste of hangover remedy soup I ate with the participants.

                            The Bundang Doosan Tower site is the place which allowed me to grow the most while working as site director. I could accumulate new technologies as well as various experiences in outstanding Bundang Doosan Tower construction site, including the special nature of the group office building, the internal and external expectations and concerns, a sense of challenge as an engineer and overcoming many difficulties as a leader.

                            It was the result of thinking together to embody constructively the designer's intention and the work environment requirements from Doosan employees, and completing it through trial and error, so I felt great pride as site director and engineer at the time of completion.

                            For me, it's not a memory, but still the best architecture of my life. Every time I pass through the Gyeongbu Expressway toll gate and the Bundang Expressway, seeing the majestic and incredible facade of the building, it makes me want to brag that I was the site director and leader of that building.

                            Recently, we have received many requests for tours of the Bundang Doosan Tower and lots of inquiries about the details of the construction. 
                            In particular, I understand that many companies want to use the Bundang Doosan Tower as a role model or benchmark it when planning a new office building. In addition, thanks to our collaboration with KPF, a world-class design company, we have been featured in overseas magazines and have received a lot of attention.
                            I hope that not only the beauty of the exterior design, but also the skills and efforts accumulated during the construction of the building will also be praised. 
                            Besides, compliments of Doosan employees are the best achievement I’ve ever had.
